When looking for a job, my goal is to:
    * create value
        * by solving hard problems
        * while working with smart people
        * who are also very kind.

Nothing particularly profound or groundbreaking, but maintaining this as a guiding principle has been helpful nevertheless. [Avoid bullshit jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs). Take on challenges that stretch your abilities, rather than on something you already know that you can do. Work with other smart people that you can learn from. And get along with. 

I have found this to be a valuable tool for reflection and self-assessment, particularly in steering clear of stagnation.

Also, I have been stuck at jobs where  all the above boxes weren't checked. Reasons varied: personal life taking precedence, waiting for that big stock or a bonus payout if I could just grind it out for a couple more months, market conditions, an upcoming vacation or simply a lack of appealing career moves.  But sticking to this principle has kept me grounded: acknowledge and accept a less-than-optimal situation instead of deceiving to myself.
