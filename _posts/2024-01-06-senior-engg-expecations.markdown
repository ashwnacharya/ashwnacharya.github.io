title:  "(My) Expectations from senior engineers"

## TL-DR:
* I expect Senior+ Engineers to demonstrate ‚ÄúStatesmanship‚Äù. 
* Baseline qualifying expectations for Senior engineers need to shift from `Unproblematic While Collaborating` to `Proactively and positively Collaborative`.

## Disclaimers.
My views here are informed by my own lived experience as an Individual Contributor for 16+ years, followed by being an Engineering Manager for the last 2, mostly at large enterprise orgs. 

Also, it is worth mentioning that almost all of my career so far has been in working in the Indian IT industry, although I am yet to come across any good reasons for the below points to be not true elsewhere.

## What is the role of a Senior+ Engineer?

The role of a Senior+ engineer depends a lot on the organization. [Matt Klein](https://mattklein123.dev/), the creator of [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/), had a twitter thread, [unrolled here](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1130206773078421504.html) where he made this distinction of Depth vs Breadth ICs.

While I really love this insight of depth vs breadth, I personally think that there is more nuance to it.


![Tradeoffs](/assets//2024-01-06/tradeoffs.png)

* First off, I personally like to think of this breadth vs depth IC distinction as two ends of a spectrum rather than a dichotomy.

* Context Acquisition and Influencing skills are always desirable in Individual Contributors, as are technical skills. **A score of zero in either dimension is never acceptable.**

* However, in a role that requires deep technical specialization, a senior engineer is *more likely to get away* with the lack of influencing skills, compared to a role at a company where the hardest problems are more about the context about a business and the historical evolution of its systems rather than of purely technical nature.


* There are a very few companies that require very senior ICs for deep technical roles. Most companies are tech-enabled, rather than deep tech companies. Technology is a means to an end. Tech is deployed to unlock non-tech business goals. And business goals are sensibly solved using fairly commoditized technologies. 

* Deep-tech roles, and therefore the niche are very much a function of the novelty of a technology. (Cloud a decade ago, big data, blockchain etc a few years ago, LLMs etc nowadays). 


* Furthermore, most deep technologies of today become commoditized over time due to market forces, so a lucrative niche deep tech role isn‚Äôt forever. If a lucrative deep-tech field exists, it is bound to attract talented engineers, thus widening the talent pool of engineers specialising in that area. Also, the speed at which deep tech becomes commoditised through Saas-ification has accelerated and will continue to do so. 


*  Moreover, even at large tech (as opposed to tech-enabled) organizations, the hardest problems are solved by leveraging org-design and concentrating niche talents in a small ring-fenced team that does the most ‚Äúhard-core‚Äù (urgghhh ü§Æ) engineering to unlock the core differentiators, with a large majority of teams working on enabling and leveraging the core deep tech differentiators, again using commoditized technologies. 

* Upon changing jobs or orgs, a breadth IC, unlike a depth IC,has to shed ALL their context and start afresh. So the most important skills that they can carry with them are their context acquisition and influencing ability.

Therefore, I believe that context acquisition and influencing skills are necessary for any Senior+ Engineer. A senior engineer cannot rely on deep tech skills alone.

## Most companies are tech-enabled.
Most companies are tech-enabled, rather than a deep tech companies. And I mean that in the most respectful, very non-pejorative way. Tech is rightly seen as a means to an end. Most companies do not produce tech for the sake of it, it is not the primary motivation. What they do instead is to deploy tech so that it would serve business goals in a manner that is scalable, cheap and sustainable. 

And that means deploying commodity tech as much as possible. Most companies largely strive to rely on popular, well established tech patterns: i.e. ‚Äúsolved problems‚Äù. 


## Chesterton fences and historical context.
Given that most companies look to solve their problems using commoditized technologies, the best practices and patterns for commodity technologies are already available, or are expected to emerge due to market forces.

Therefore, it stands to reason that the hard problems at companies aren‚Äôt inherently tech: they are organizational, and contextual. Solving these problems require a deep understanding of how the systems originated and evolved: How a complex, constantly rebalancing system of forces like yearly roadmaps,  quarterly plans, historic personalities, time pressures, shaped these systems into the way they are today. Engineers are required to reverse engineer these systems to solve problems. Simply put, solving problems at large companies requires context.

And oftentimes, a lot of this context is not obvious. It is not documented. A companies with good documentation are rarer than unicorns. So the context is not evident immediately. It has to be teased out: extracted, by patient, technically skilled engineers who are great at proactively seeking collaboration across org boundary lines.

Therefore, acquiring context, understanding the systems and solving problems require highly skilled engineers to talk to other highly skilled engineers.




## So what do I expect from Senior Engineers?
**An effective Senior Engineer is expected to demonstrate STATESMANSHIP with high levels of [Influence Without Authority](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/123686).**

A highly effective senior engineer is expected to navigate org boundaries and acquire context. They are expected to build relationships, form personal networks, create win-win situations, pick the right battles, resolve conflicts, [be an effective heretic...](https://medium.com/@royrapoport/that-burning-feeling-when-youre-right-cee8b8d05492)

In fact, I strongly believe that a senior engineer position should come with baseline expectations of statesmanship: mentorship, collaboration, negotiation, creating win-win situations, and influence without authority. These qualities should be evaluated during hiring as well as during promoting engineers to senior+ positions.

## What are you doing wrong?
I often see companies being accepting of Senior Engineers with less than ideal "soft-skills" because they are "technical". 

I strongly disagree with the notion that being a senior engineer is a position where you can just be in your technical comfort zone and not talk to other teams and stakeholders. It is NOT a position you take because you don‚Äôt want to talk to people, as opposed to a management position which requires you to ‚Äútalk‚Äù. A lot of companies accept this [wordcel vs shape rotator distinction](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkpqzb/ok-wtf-are-wordcels-and-shape-rotators) as some weird law of nature and do nothing to address it. This, in my opinion, is often a grave mistake. 

A senior engineer should not be a recluse: they are not someone who you break glass and engage when in need of solving a highly technical problem. 


## What happens if you don't have this expectation?
By not having a baseline expectation of influence, companies not only lower the bar for senior engineers, they also disincentivise growth in this area. The qualifying criteria for a senior engineer is reduced to merely ‚Äúbeing unproblematic while collaborating‚Äù rather than ‚Äúproactively, postively collaborative‚Äù.

Engineers who demonstrate social skills and influence without authority are seen as an exception, rather than the norm, and often rewarded with managerial responsibilities. Not only is this a great disservice to the Engineering craftsmanship, they are doing themselves a disservice by taking away the most influential engineers away from where they are needed the most: as close to the code as possible, and talking to other engineers.

And because most companies are tech enabled as opposed to deep-tech, they neither offer avenues for Individual Contributors to acquire deep specialization in highly technical fields, nor do they offer career options for breadth ICs who do not want to get into management.

Therefore, a senior IC who wants to continue on the IC path runs into what is effectively a glass ceiling. 

And... the business problems remain unsolved.
