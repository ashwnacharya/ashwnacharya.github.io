## TL-DR:
* This blog is a way for $people to check out my opinions, should they be curious.
    * $people âˆˆ {those I trust and respect, those I choose to engage with, those looking to employ me.}


## Why am I starting a blog now?
I believe that I have valuable experience and insights on leading cloud and infrastructure teams, navigating careers in large enterprise companies, delivering high-quality software and solving hard problems.

Having recently relocated from ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ to ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±, my ability to stay in my new country is closely tied to maintaining my employment here. Having a website and writing down things is a worthwhile endeavour in that regard: hopefully it serves as a public "proof of competence" and enhances my employability.

Earlier, I was happy with just accumulating knowledge and experience and not really concerned about putting out proof. This was largely due to my lack of skills necessary for crafting well-edited content. I am mostly a consumer and seldom a creator of well-crafted text. Also, not having public proof hasn't held me back from finding meaningful opportunities.

However, with GenerativeAI being a thing now, obtaining competent editorial feedback is no longer a challenge.

Moreover, it is fair to assume that more senior roles are comparatively harder to come by. Also, I am now more picky about the kind of jobs I would take. Having a blog hopefully provides me a way to stand out, and a prospective employer a fairly good idea of what they are going to get.


## Questions that i needed to answer.
After I created my website,  I pondered on ways to share it with a wider audience:
* How should I get feedback for my content?
* Should I expand my reach?
* Who should be reading my content?


## Getting feedback.
I'm not overly concerned about putting out perfect timeless content. Instead, I view my posts as a snapshot of my perspectives at specific points in time. It will be intriguing to observe how my views evolve.

So, apart from cosmetic changes and rewording something once I have found a better word or phrase to express my thoughts, my posts are going to be fairly immutable, and any followups are going to be posts of its own.

Hence, I won't actively seek feedback just for the sake of improving the content.

This also imposes on me the responsibility of expressing views that I am willing to own, even if they change in the future. I am comfortable doing that.


## Should I expand my reach?
I am most definitely not looking to be an influencer. My [goal is to work on hard problems with smart, kind people](/2024/01/05/smart-kind-hard) and the vast majority of the people are.... not that. 

Broadcasting my viewpoints feels pointless: I am not looking to invite attention or engage in debate with people I don't care about. Also, I also have no interest in imposing my perceived wisdom on those who haven't sought it willingly. Therefore, I am not proactively looking for engagement. Trying to expand my reach isn't really aligned with my goals.


## Who would be reading my content?
My goal is to provide evidence of my competence for those who seek it.

And these are likely to be the people I choose to engage with: a colleague, someone I aspire to work with, someone I at a conference or a meetup, or engage with online in the select few forums that I participate in.

Given my reserved and intensely private nature, I don't foresee this blog garnering substantial traffic. 

My audience will primarily discover my content when they intentionally click on a link within my profile or resume.


## Still happy to stay off social media.
I have actively avoided most social media. I do have a [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashwnacharya) unfortunately, because that is where most of the recruiters are. I aspire to not having one; but I am not there yet.

I must admit, I was somewhat stressed about maintaining a Twitter account, sharing links on Reddit, seeking engagement on Linkedin and engaging in discussions: basically indulging in all the influencer shenanigans.

Therefore, gaining this clarity and being decisive about my engagement model was quite liberating.
