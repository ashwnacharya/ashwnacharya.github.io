## TL-DR:
* Specifically relevant to foreign software companies with offices in India.
* Teams in Indian offices of these companies typically handle three types of software projects:
    * Staff augmentation
    * Shared Ownership
    * Total Ownership


## What am I talking about?
With a few exceptions, I've spent the majority of my career working in the Indian offices of large US-based enterprise companies.

Typically, these enterprise companies have their headquarters situated in the US or Europe. For instance, Microsoft's headquarters is in Redmond, VMWare's in San Francisco, and Booking.com's in Amsterdam.

The headquarters (HQ) is the mothership: the geolocation with the most significant presence of senior leaders within the company.

Conversely, offices in other countries are frequently labeled as "Development Centres" or "Center of Excellence." However, for the purpose of this discussion, let's refer to them as Satellites.

Based on my experience, projects or teams in satellite offices typically fall into one of the following three broad categories.


### 1. Staff augmentation
The Staff Augmentation model involves the team in a satellite region primarily offering low-level headcount to a team based at the HQ.

The headcount is mostly junior or mid-level engineers, along with a frontline EM or a team lead. 

Major decisions are predominantly made at the mothership and then conveyed to the satellite teams. Consequently, a key indicator of the staff-augmented model is when architects, product managers, designers, etc., are primarily based at the mothership.

Within this team, the work typically involves executing marching orders issued by the mothership. The quality of delivery is frequently assessed based on how closely it aligns with the specifications provided by the mothership, encompassing both the interpretation of the spec and the execution.

A staff augmentation arrangement is typically encountered when the team or organization at the satellite is still in the phase of finding its feet.

They are still in the process of building credibility and earning trust, which makes the leadership at the mothership understandably hesitant to hand over the reins.

Engineers in this team primarily experience growth by assisting the satellite leadership in earning credibility and trust.

Leaders at a satellite organization usually aim to earn credibility and trust by leveraging organizational design and cost arbitrage benefits to increase output. However, the results are mixed, mainly because Mythical Man-Month principles still hold true.


### 2. Shared Ownership
As staff augmentation teams mature, they transition into a Shared Ownership model, placing the satellite teams more or less on equal footing with their counterparts at the mothership.

Additional context is shared, and there is a heightened level of trust in the capabilities of the offshore team. The satellite teams are entrusted with good judgment and empowered to make critical decisions.

Responsibilities are delineated along module or workstream boundaries due to timezone challenges, which hinder effective collaboration across different geographical locations.

At times, the nature of the product and/or the distribution of customers necessitates the adoption of a Shared Ownership model: For instance, this is applicable when a product demands a follow-the-sun model to maintain its availability and meet reliability SLOs, or when a product has a substantial customer base situated in the same geographic location as the satellite team.

An alternative to the Shared Ownership model is where the mothership owns the core differentiators for a product, i.e., the more challenging aspects, while the satellite teams handle the easier, more commoditized components. The reasons for this are primarily consistent with why motherships are motherships: greater talent density, a history of ownership, a proven track record, and so on.

A well-functioning shared responsibility model is often envisioned as the terminal state desired by the company's senior leadership. A successful outcome is frequently the result of a meticulously planned and well-executed [Inverse Conway's Maneuver](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ConwaysLaw.html).


### 3. Total Ownership
A total ownership model is when a product is owned end-to-end by the satellite team. This typically signifies a high level of trust in the talent and execution capabilities of the satellite team.

In certain cases, this stems from the leadership at the mothership giving the satellite organization an opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities by taking on a low-risk, high-reward initiative.

Alternatively, this involves a revenue-generating product in sunset/maintenance mode being transferred to the satellite team while the mothership teams shift their focus to riskier, more promising initiatives.

While uncommon, it is not entirely unheard of for a satellite team to take ownership of a high-risk, high-reward project.


## A variation of the Pioneers-Settlers-Town-planners
In a sense, the above model serves as an alternative perspective—an observation from the other side, so to speak—of the [Pioneers, Settlers and Town Planners](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/03/on-pioneers-settlers-town-planners-and.html) model proposed by [Simon Wardley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonwardley/).

An executive at the mothership pioneers the offshore model for the first time through the establishment of a staff augmentation engagement. With time, the settler phase involves discovering best practices and failure modes, ultimately transitioning to the town planner phase for extracting maximum value.


## Observations and Caveats

**Clusters on a spectrum:** It is useful to view this model as clusters on a spectrum, rather than as discrete, well-defined buckets.

**Not a broad brush:**  It is most effective to apply this model in a very granular manner, specifically at a team or organizational level, rather than at the entire company level. It is not uncommon for different parts of a company to be at different points of the spectrum.

**A point in time snapshot:** Teams are continually evolving, influenced by various tectonic forces. Therefore, it is beneficial to utilize this model to depict the state of a team or organization at a specific point in time, rather than as a permanent label.


## How to use this mental model?
Personally, I have found this model to be valuable when assessing potential job offers.

For instance, an offer from a team following a staff augmentation model can be viewed as an opportunity to lead the transition towards a shared ownership model, assuming alignment among the leaders at the satellite location.

Likewise, a Total Ownership model can be considered as a means to achieve a better work-life balance with no calls and meetings beyond work hours, along with increased autonomy, and so on.

A Shared Ownership model, on the other hand, offers the opportunity to be on equal footing with counterparts from the mothership. However, it may entail trade-offs such as frequent short-term trips, meetings scheduled beyond work hours, and navigating differences in work culture, among other considerations.

Thus, there is no model of engagement that is inherently superior or inferior.
