## TL-DR:
* Sign up for goals you are 80% qualified for.
* Progressively overloading over time results in compounding.


## What is Progressive Overload?
Follow any accomplished strength training expert, and you will soon come across the principle called "Progressive Overload".

The idea of Progressive Overload is simple. If you can lift a specific weight for a set number of reps, consider either adding more weight or increasing the number of reps inorder to become stronger. Continuously lifting the same weight for a consistent number of reps makes you good at exactly that, but it won't enhance your ability to lift heavier weights for more reps.

Personally, I find the concept of progressive overload compelling. It involves identifying your comfort zone, making efforts to step out of it without going so far that failure is imminent, but just enough to provide a meaningful chance for success.


## Don't be an Expert Beginner.
Remaining within the comfort zone for an extended period can lead to being an [Expert Beginner](https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/). An expert beginner possesses sufficient knowledge to tackle familiar problems, despite existing inadequacies and bad habits. However, their avoidance of more challenging issues prevents the awareness and correction of these shortcomings. The lack of exposure to demanding problems hinders growth, leaving them incapable of addressing higher-level challenges.


## The 80% rule.
So, How far beyond your comfort zone do you dare to venture? I find it personally beneficial to take on challenges where I am approximately 80% qualified. Why 80 and not 75 or 83? No particular reason; 80 just resonates as a rounded figure, aligning with the familiar 80-20 rule.

<sup>I am pretty sure I picked up the 80% rule advice from one of the Coursera lectures by Dr. Andrew Ng. </sup>

Taking on tasks at the 80% qualification level stretches your current limits, pushing them further. Upon completing the task, you achieve 100% qualification, as you've just successfully accomplished it. It's essentially a tautology. Consistently following the 80% rule will lead to the benefits compounding over time. Compounding is very powerful but typically non-intuitive.

Personally, I find the 80% rule to be a valuable mental model when choosing the next side project or setting goals. It becomes particularly useful when evaluating job offers: being 80% qualified for a role provides a solid foundation for success while allowing ample room for personal growth. Anything below or beyond the 80% threshold sets the stage for failure, even if the potential failure scenarios vary widely.
