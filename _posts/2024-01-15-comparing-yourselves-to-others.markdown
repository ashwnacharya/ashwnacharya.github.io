## TL-DR:
* Use the [80% rule](2024/01/10/progressive-overloading) when comparing yourself to others.
* Use it to identify the way forward.


## Comparison can be valuable.
There's an abundance of self-help literature advising against comparison, claiming it steals joy, and promoting the idea that one's sole competition should be oneself. These are generally sound principles.

Personally, I find comparison to be a beneficial tool in navigating my career, as long as I limit myself to comparing with those who are only slightly ahead of me within a similar timeframe.

This for me, aligns neatly with the [80% rule](2024/01/10/progressive-overloading).

Deconstructing the journey of someone who has achieved slightly more than me proves insightful: What worked well for them? What circumstances led to their faster advancement? What skills did they possess, and what new skills did they acquire? What books influenced them? Who are their role models? What projects did they undertake? Were they at the right place at the right time? How did they get there? Reasoning about the answers for these questions help in identifying growth areas and opportunities that might otherwise remain unnoticed.

It's crucial, however, to note that it is futile to compare oneself to someone significantly further ahead when I cannot envision a viable path to reach such heights. Chances are, there's a former colleague or a classmate with a net worth in the hundreds of millions, cruising in a Maserati,  retired early to enjoy life on a beach, <i>some other arbitrary definition of success</i>...

In such cases, they were likely dealt a vastly different set of cards or are simply better card players than I am. In such instances, it's best to acknowledge the vast difference, shrug, and move on.

<sup>Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.</sup>
