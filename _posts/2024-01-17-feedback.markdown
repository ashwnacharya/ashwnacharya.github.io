## TL-DR:
* Purpose of giving feedback is to induce improvement.
* Find the smallest thing that has a good chance of landing well.
* The harsher the feedback, more the trust needed for it to land well.
* More delayed the feedback, tougher the conversation.
* It is not them, it is just the thing they do.
* Mind your tone and body language.
* Always welcome feedback: it is telemetry.
