I mostly try to approach my day job like it is a video game: I do get mildly disappointed when I lose a round or am not able complete a quest but I don't let that affect me.

While it remains hard to achieve and sustain this detachment, I have found that it leads to better outcomes. Emotions are mostly a distraction in a professional setting.
