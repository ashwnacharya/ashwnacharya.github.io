## Feedback is a gift
Giving feedback is an act of kindness. You give feedback when you genuinely want someone to do better. By giving someone feedback, you are making them aware of a gap, a deficiency: converting an unknown to a known. This is an act of benevolence. 

## Purpose of giving feedback is to induce improvement.
By converting an unknown deficiency to a known deficiency, you are empowering the receiver to improve. Feedback is essential for improvement.

## Trust is essential for feedback.
For someone to process your feedback well, they need to know that you are acting in their best interests, that you want the best for them. They need to be able to trust your judgement in order to respect your feedback.
