<sub>Note: Real world leadership is not 2 dimensional. However, the screen that you are reading this on, is. Therefore, this diagram is a 2D projection of an n-dimensional problem space. Also, One of those dimensions is time. No, not the x-axis. The points in space are centroids of your current and desired net state. At this point we are overthinking this. Just play along with me please...ðŸ¤“</sub>

<sub>Roles dictate the ownership of certain decisions. Therefore, there are some decisions that are yours alone to make, by the nature of your role. You can, however, seek feedback before making them. But feedback that influenced a certain decision does not absolve you of the responsibility of owning the decision and its consequences.</sub>

<sub>It is where you make decisions far beyond the scope of your role. Extreme example: think of a CEO dictating the use of tabs opposed to spaces.</sub>

<sub>A bad leader can still have some good ideas. However, they fail to create clarity and share context around those ideas, resulting in *misalignment*. </sub>

<sub>A good leader can still make decisions that turn out to be bad in hindsight. Where you thought you were going, may not be where you wanted to be. Because a good quality decision can still have bad outcomes. And that's okay.</sub>
