## TL-DR:
* You need to understand something thoroughly enough to disagree with it.
* You need to quarantine your disagreement in order to commit to a decision.

I grew up in a very religious family. In fact my father was a priest. And my mother continues to be a deeply pious woman. Religion was a big part of my childhood. I grew up around the premises of a Hindu temple. The same temple that my father was employed at.

## My religious background
I would often assist my father in conducting religious ceremonies. And help my mother cook religious offerings. And I would read a lot about religion: Spiritual texts. Mythology. Learn sacred verses by heart. Participate in quizzes about religion. Or even help conduct them.

Nowadays, I am an agnostic; I am not an outright atheist: an irrational part of me is probably still scared of being wrong about God not existing ðŸ˜…. [Pascal's wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager) and all that. But I am mostly irreligious. 


I think I have spent enough time studying and practicing my religion to boadly reject it. Or at least the most commonly held idea of it. 

However, my religion is a big part of me. 

* My mother is still very religious. And part of my duty as her son is to participate in my religion; to carry out duties that my religion requires of me. And I try my best to do that. With the utmost sincerity that I can muster. This requires me to quarantine my actual feelings about the dogma and religious rituals and actually participate in them.

* And there is an aspect of religion that I retain: the idea of justice and equality for all, a universalism that transcends boundaries, that form my values.  

## The only way to atheism is through religion.

[Slavoj Å½iÅ¾ek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavoj_%C5%BDi%C5%BEek) asserts that the only way to atheism is through religion. The only way to stop believing in "religion" *(or at least what people mean by religion, ie. the dogma; the idea of a Transcendent God, the rituals, the theatrics that people commonly associate with "religion")*, is to experience it firsthand, see what gives them meaning: (i.e. the vibe of solidarity with other human beings, the idea of pursuit of justice and equality for all) and then embracing the vibe, and rejecting the dogma.

What also resonates with me the most here is the act of first striving to believe in it: to live with those ideals and understand what it really gives them meaning, see if the meaning resonates with you. 


## What does it mean to disagree?
And this brings me to my interpretation of "Disagree and commit". 

Disagreements should come at a cost: the time and effort spent to understand something well enough to disagree with it. You cannot really disagree with something you do not understand: because then it is a dislike, not disagreement per se. How strongly you disagree with something is a function of how well you understand it.

<sub>Dislike is a gut feel, uninformed. Disagreement is informed.</sub>


## What does it mean to commit?
The commitment that "disagree and commit" demands, is therefore, two-fold: 

* The first commitment is hidden in the act of disagreeing with something: You need to commit to understand something well enough before you decide to disagree. This by definition, includes a commitment not to confuse your dislike for disagreement.

* The second commitment is towards the decision itself: to quarantine your disagreement well enough to not let it affect your actions: to commit to act in your full professional capacity to contribute to the success of that decision, despite you disagreeing with it.
