## TL-DR:
* You need to understand something thoroughly enough to disagree with it.
* You need to quarantine your disagreement in order to commit to a decision.


## What does it mean to disagree?
It is important to make the distinction between "dislike" and "disagreement". For me, a dislike is something instinctive, based on my gut-feeling about something.

People often confuse "dislike" with "disagreement".

A gut-feel, an instinctive reaction, is free. Every sentient human being has them. There is no effort involved. 

Disagreements, however, come at a cost: the time and effort spent to understand something well enough to disagree with it. You cannot really disagree with something you do not understand: because then it is a dislike, not disagreement per se. 

How strongly you disagree with something is a function of how well you understand it.

## What does it mean to commit?
The commitment that "disagree and commit" demands, therefore, is two-fold: 

* The first commitment is hidden in the act of disagreeing with something: You need to commit to understand something well enough before you decide to disagree. This by definition, includes a commitment to not confuse your dislike for disagreement.

* The second commitment is towards the decision itself: to quarantine your disagreement and not let it affect your actions: to commit to act in your full professional capacity to contribute to the success of that decision, despite you disagreeing with it.


## What "disagree and commit" is not
"Disagree and commit" cannot be a call to follow orders without fully understanding them. 

Rather, it is a call to

* Invest time and effort to understand the rationale behind a decision, get over your initial dislike, if any.
* Decide if you still disagree with it.
    * And if you still do, then quarantine your disagreement and be a professional and commit to the success of a decision that has already been made. i.e. DO YOUR JOB.

What this also means is that you can only "disagree and commit" to a decision that has already been made. Decisions that are yet to be made obviously cannot be committed to.
