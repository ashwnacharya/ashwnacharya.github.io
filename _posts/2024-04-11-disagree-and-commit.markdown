## TL-DR:
* You need to understand something thoroughly enough to disagree with it.
* You need to quarantine your disagreement in order to commit to a decision.

## The only way to atheism is through religion.
I grew up in a very religious family. In fact my father was a priest. And my mother continues to be a deeply pious woman. Religion was a big part of my childhood. I grew up around the premises of a Hindu temple. The same temple that my father was employed at.

I would often assist my father in conducting religious ceremonies. And help my mother cook religious offerings. And I would read a lot about religion: Spiritual texts. Mythology. Learn sacred verses by heart. Participate in quizzes about religion. Or even help conduct them.

<sub>My father would sit inside the shrines. Sometimes, when required, I would sit on the platform on the right.</sub>

Nowadays, I am an agnostic; I am not an outright atheist: an irrational part of me is probably still scared of being wrong. [Pascal's wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager) and all that. But I am mostly irreligous.


I think I have spent enough time studying and practicing my religion to boadly reject it. [Slavoj Žižek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavoj_%C5%BDi%C5%BEek) says that the only way to atheism is through religion. I agree. The only way to stop believing in something is by first striving to believing in it. 

However, my religion is a big part of me. My mother is still very religious. And part of my duty as her son is to participate in my religion; to carry out duties that my religion requires of me. And I try my best to do that. With the utmost sincerity that I can muster.


## What does it mean to disagree?
And this brings me to my interpretation of "Disagree and commit". 

Disagreements should come at a cost: the time and effort spent to understand something well enough to disagree with it. You cannot really disagree with something you do not understand: because then it is a dislike, not disagreement per se. How strongly you disagree with something is a function of how well you understand it.

<sub>Dislike is a gut feel, uninformed. Disagreement is informed.</sub>


## What does it mean to commit?
The commitment that "disagree and commit" demands, is therefore, two-fold: 

* The first commitment is hidden in the act of disagreeing with something: You need to commit to understand something well enough before you decide to disagree. This by definition, includes a commitment not to confuse your dislike for disagreement.

* The second commitment is towards the decision itself: to quarantine your disagreement well enough to not let it affect your actions: to commit to act in your full professional capacity to contribute to the success of that decision, despite you disagreeing with it.
