Hi, I'm an engineer originally from Bangalore, India, now residing in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

This is my blog. Here, I mostly document thoughts about technology and lessons learned. Often, I find it more convenient to share a link from here when I want to pass along my insights or viewpoints.

So for what it is worth, the primary user of this blog is me. Feel free to take a look though ðŸ˜Š
