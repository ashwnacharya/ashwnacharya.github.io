Hi 👋! I'm a long-time (15+ years) Engineer and Individual Contributor turned Engineering Manager. I am originally from Bangalore, India 🇮🇳 but recently I relocated to Amsterdam, Netherlands 🇳🇱 🚲.


This is my blog. Here, I mostly document thoughts about technology and lessons learned. Often, I find it more convenient to share a link from here when I want to pass along my insights or views.

So for what it is worth, the primary user of this blog is me. Feel free to take a look though 😊
