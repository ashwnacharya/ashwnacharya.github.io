Hi ğŸ‘‹! I'm a long-time Engineer and Individual Contributor turned Engineering Manager. I have been based out of Bangalore, India ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ but I recently relocated to Amsterdam, Netherlands. ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡± ğŸš²


This is my blog. Here, I mostly document thoughts about technology and lessons learned. Often, I find it more convenient to share a link from here when I want to pass along my insights or views.

So for what it is worth, the primary user of this blog is me. Feel free to take a look though ğŸ˜Š
