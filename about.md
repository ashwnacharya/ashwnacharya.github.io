Hi ğŸ‘‹!  I'm an experienced engineer who transitioned from an individual contributor to an Engineering Manager. Originally from Bangalore ğŸŒ³, India ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³, I've recently made Amsterdam ğŸš², Netherlands ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡±  my new home.

Welcome to my blog! Here, I share my perspectives on engineering, technology and the lessons I've learned along the way. [I maintain this blog as a way for people to learn more about me](/2024/01/07/social-media-engagement-model).

Sometimes, I find it easier to drop a link from here whenever I want to share my views.

I stay away from most social media but for professional connections, you can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashwnacharya).
