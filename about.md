Hi ğŸ‘‹!  I'm an experienced engineer who transitioned from an individual contributor to an Engineering Manager. Originally from Bangalore ğŸŒ³, India ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³, I've recently made Amsterdam ğŸš², Netherlands ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡±  my new home.

Welcome to my blog! Here, I share my perspectives on engineering, technology and the lessons I've learned along the way. Sometimes, I find it easier to drop a link from here whenever I want to share my thoughts or views.

I mostly stay away from social media but for professional connections, you can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashwnacharya).
